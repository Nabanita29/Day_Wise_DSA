Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].


class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        
        // Adjust the low to the first odd if even
        if(low % 2 == 0){
            low++;
        }
        // Adjust the high to a odd if even
        if(high % 2 == 0){
            high--;
        }

        // Stop condition
        if(low > high){
            return 0;
        }

        return(high - low)/2 + 1;
        
    }
}
